The technical contribution of the take-off trajectory
generation method seems to the reviewer to be minor.

It might also be helpful to add a phrase such as "based on
simulation of BLDC motors" to the title.

The authors should also measure and report the data of
the actual machine for n0 to n4 in Fig. 13.

In the introduction, it is unclear how one-leg jumping
contributes to the development of agile quadruped, the end
goal of this study.
It should be explained that how higher jumping and energy
regeneration promote agility of quadrpedal locomotion.
If the goal is efficient locomotion, energy consumption
should be considered in all phases including takeoff phase.

In the aerial phase, the robot cannot obtain any force, and
the motion of the robot is uniquely determined.
Then, maximizing jumping height at T_{appex} is identical
maximizing takeoff velocity at T_{takeoff}.
Why did the duration from the takeoff to the appex 
consider in the problem?
