Comments to the author
======================

Summary:
This paper proposes a method for maximizing the jumping
height and minimizing the dissipated energy due to landing
in the generation of jumping trajectories.
For the dissipated energy minimization method, the authors
model the relationship between landing impact and energy
recuperation at the electricaly-actuation level.
Since the optimization problem of trajectory planning is
complicated due to the formulation and computational
complexity, the optimization problem is divided into the
take-off phase and the landing phase for simplification.
The performance of energy recuperation is evaluated through
simulations and experiments on the actual machine.

Major concern:
- Technical novelty
The technical contribution of the take-off trajectory
generation method seems to the reviewer to be minor.
On the other hand, it is interesting that the authors try
to analyze the kinetic energy at the electrical level and
regenerate energy in landing trajectory generation, which
is novel as far as the reviewer knows.
The authors use the expression "electrically-actuated" in
the fifth paragraph of the Introduction, but the paper
would be more clear and easy to understand if the authors
added the expression "simulate Field Oriented Control on
BLDC motors based on Direct-quadrature-zero
transformation".
It might also be helpful to add a phrase such as "based on
simulation of BLDC motors" to the title.

- Unclear definitions of variables
The definitions of the following variables are unclear. It
is extremely unkind of the paper to make readers guess
these.

-- Ambiguity of the components of v
Does the first component of v refer to the vertical
velocity and the other two represent the joint velocities?
In Fig. 4, the units of all components are rad/s^2, but
according to Eq.(30), isn't the unit of the first component
of v m/s?

-- Ambiguity of the dimensions and components of q and q^.
As with v, the component of q is ambiguous.
According to Eq.(42), q^ &#8712; R^2, but according to
Eq.(39h) and the definition of q in Sec. IIIA), it is
3-dimensional.
The authors should correct these discrepancies.

Also, since the order of the joints is not specified, it is
not clear at first glance which joints are q1 and q2.
An explanation should be added near Fig. 5.

-- Ambiguity of the dimensions of Kp and Kd in Fig. 7
In Fig.7, it seems that Kp, Kd &#8712; R, which is
inconsistent with q &#8712; R^2. Did you use the same
stiffness and impedance gain for all joints?

Minor concern:
- The authors should also measure and report the data of
the actual machine for n0 to n4 in Fig. 13.
- Eq.(19) is the same as Eq.(3), so it is unnecessary to
write it twice.
