Comments to the author
======================

This paper proposed a trajectory optimization for one-leg
jumping, which consists of two stages: takeoff and landing.
The method was validated by both simulations and hardware
experiments.
The TO is designed to maximize jump height during the
takeoff phase and energy recovery during the landing phase.
Features of the method is that it take into account current
effects in electorical motors.
For takeoff, motor current limitation with torque is took
into account as a constraint.
Energy regeneration by impact is maximized while landing.
As the authors mentioned, analysis of the impact dynamics
and energy regeneration written in Sec. III-D and III-E is
novel and very interesting.
However, there are some unclear parts in this paper.


In the introduction, it is unclear how one-leg jumping
contributes to the development of agile quadruped, the end
goal of this study.
It should be explained that how higher jumping and energy
regeneration promote agility of quadrpedal locomotion.
If the goal is efficient locomotion, energy consumption
should be considered in all phases including takeoff phase.

Sec. III is well written, and especially III-D is very
interesting.
Both cost functions (9) and (41) have conflicting terms
(e.g. the velocity term and the jumping height).
Usually, the balance between them are resolved by weight
parameters.
If the weights did not require for the problems, please
state it.

The input vector $u_b$ in (6) does not exist in the cost
function and the constraints of (21). 
A state equation is needed to define, and is better used as
the constraint of (21), instead of the rigid body dynamics
(1).
In the aerial phase, the robot cannot obtain any force, and
the motion of the robot is uniquely determined.
Then, maximizing jumping height at T_{appex} is identical
maximizing takeoff velocity at T_{takeoff}.
Why did the duration from the takeoff to the appex 
consider in the problem?

If my calculations are correct, the sign between two
$\dot{x}_{tip}$ in (26) is negative.
However, if the sign is negative, the following discussion
becomes false.
Please review this part.

There is no definition of $l^I_{\Delta E_k}$ in (41).
