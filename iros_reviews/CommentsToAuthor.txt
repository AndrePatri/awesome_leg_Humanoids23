=====================================

This manuscript studies jumping and landing controller
design for a single leg system with the consideration of
energy optimality and energy regeneration. Through
incorporating a low-level motor/power flow model into the
optimal control/optimization scheme, the energy
considerations can be directly incorporated.
Overall, most reviewers find the idea of taking into
account of low-level model and energy considerations in the
jumping controller synthesis interesting. However, several
major concerns are raised as well.
R2, R6, R11 and R13 share the concern that the reported
experimental results are not enough and not convincing,
especially in the demonstration of the energy recovery
ability during landing phase. R2 and R11 ask for a careful
explanation on how to conduct the energy regeneration
experiment with hardware platforms. R6 and R9 both point
out that the motivation of this work unclear. They both
raise concerns about challenges in extending the controller
from a single leg system to a whole legged robotic system.
R6 points out the contributions are overclaimed and R9
thinks the contribution marginal. Contributions of this
manuscript should be clarified. 
All these comments should be carefully taken into
consideration in future revisions.

Some clarifications are encouraged, and more experimental
results are called for by the reviewers. See comments from
R9 and R11 in specific.
