Comments to the author
======================

This paper proposes a two-stage trajectory optimization for
the design and execution of agile jumping maneuvers. The
proposed framework works as follows. A take-off
the optimization problem is formulated using a general
floating-base dynamic model and an accurate actuation
model. This method can maximize the apex height by
optimizing take-off trajectory parameters. A landing
optimization problem is formulated using the impact
dynamics and energy flow models. This method can
maximize regenerated energy by optimizing landing
configuration and impedance. The two optimizations are
offline and validated on a single leg in simulation and
hardware. 

While the two-stage trajectory optimization mentioned in
the paper is interesting, basically, the authors should add
more experiments to verify their method. Here are the
comments:

(1)In the Experimental setup section of the author's video,
I noticed that they have a 50:1 gear ratio, according to my
experience, a large portion of the recovered energy may be
lost in the transmission. And in the measured regeneration
part of the author’s video, I noticed that the regeneration
power is relatively small compared to the takeoff power.
So, is it necessary to do the optimization of energy
regeneration?
(2)The authors mention energy recovery as an innovation in
their article, so I think it is also necessary to explain
how energy recovery is implemented at the hardware level. 
(3)Energy regeneration is an important part of the paper,
the authors only gave simulation results in Section IV B,
and only compared a set of Kd, and Kp values, I think the
authors need to give the hardware test results while
comparing more Kd, Kp, and q.
(4)In Fig.3. and Fig.8., the authors did experiments to
verify their actuator model and power flow model, but these
experiments were conducted at relatively low speed, how to
ensure that these models are still accurate under the
the high-speed motion of jumping?
(5)There have been a lot of papers on a quadruped robot
jumping problems such as gradient-based or learning-based
jumping methods, so a comparison with these methods should
be added in the INTRODUCTION or PROBLEM FRAMING AND STATE
OF THE ART section.
(6)In equations (7) and (35), the authors choose to take
the different cost functions quadratically and add them
directly without giving weights. Does this reduce the
convergence speed of the algorithm because lf, lv, etc. are
of different magnitudes and thus have different effects on
the final cost?
(7)In equations (21) and (44), can these two equations be
written in a more mathematical form?
(8)In Fig.4. What do the title ‘v’ and ‘iq’ of Joint
accelerations and ground reaction force mean?
(9)In Fig.9. and Fig.10., it seems that the error between
the computed value and the hardware test value are not
small, can you explain where the error comes from?
(10)In Sections IV A and B part, the authors mention the
iterations before the convergence of their take-off and
landing optimization, I think convergence curves with
iterations need to be added to the two optimizations.

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

The content of the video basically shows the work of the
paper, but more videos about the experiments need to be
added so that the reader can better understand the paper.
