Associate editor synthetic comments:
- the idea of integrating the low-level and energy reg. model is considered to be interesting.
- exp results not convincing, particularly in the proof of energy regeneration during landing.
- more in depth explanation on how to conduct energy reg, on the hardware.
- unclear motivations: challenges in extending such a scheme to a whole legged system.
- overclaimed/marginal contributions: more clear outline required.

R2: 
- two stage opt. interesting, but more experimental results
- video: regeneration power relatively small compared to takeoff power. Does it make sense to optimize for landing?
- explain how en. rec. is performed at the hardware level (do we mention energy recovery as a contribution?!?!?!)
- more sets of Kp, Kd, q_landing
- concerns of accuracy of power models during high speed maneuvers (retrive data from exps to address this?)
- comparison with gradient/learning methods for jumping in Intro/Framing/SoA section
- eq (7)- (35) look like each cost has same weight (specify this explicitly in the revision)
- more mathematical form for eqs (21) and (44) 
- typo in Fig. 4: remove v and iq or change title
- Fig. 9 - 10: error apparently not small (more clear comparison? more in depth justification of mismatches?)
- request of tajeoff/landing optimization convergence curves (cost VS iterations?)
- video: more videos of the experiments
